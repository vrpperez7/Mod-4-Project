# Business Problem:

### I am a data analyst on the BikeShare Product team. Our stakeholders have given me the job to extract insights from hourly usage data. They'd like me to give a general overview of the business and how to best support the company.

## The stakeholders are:

### <ins>Primary Stakeholder's interests:</ins>
***Park General Manager*** would like to know:
- When demand is strong or fragile.
- User behavior patterns.
- Which hypotheses to prioritize next quarter.

### <ins>Supporting Stakeholders' interests:</ins></br>
**Operations Lead:**
- Low-impact maintenance windows.

**Marketing Lead:**
- Promo timing.
- Segments of casual rider vs registered.

**Policy & Ethics Advisor:**
- Avoiding decisions that disadvantage specific times/areas

### So we ask the question: 

## How can we best ensure the safety, efficiency, and profits for our bikes during work days?
